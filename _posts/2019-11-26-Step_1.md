### In order to fit in, you must identify your strengths and weaknesses. What are you good at? Why do others critisize you? 

##### You are not fitting in because there are things about you that others don't like. That's the truth. The good thing is, if you try hard enough, you will be able to change. The question is, how hard are you going to try?

#### To make it easier for you to find your flaws, here is a list of socially unaccepted things. Do you have any of them?

[] You are fat or on the heavier side of average

[] You have glasses

[] You talk about any of the following: science , politics, religion

(Bonus points if these are the only things you talk about, in which case *you need to step it up!*)

[] You look hideous

[] You care about some random franchise nobody has ever heard of

[] You have a disease that is shown externally
