## Congrats!
### If you've made it this far, you should know what others hate about you, what you should change yourself to, and how to do it. You should be successful in creating a mask to hide your true self behind.

### However, you're not done yet. After all, creating the mask is one thing. Keeping it is an entirely different matter. To help, here are some questions that you should ask yourself every once in a while to make sure you're still being accepted.

### 1. Have I been doing anything that is out of character?
How have you been behaving lately? Have people's preceptions of me changed because I have not been behaving as expected?

### 2. Has anybody seen behind my facade?
Has anybody seen you reveal your true personality? Have they told other people? 

### 3. Am I still keeping up with societal norms?
These things change very often. Popular people stay on top of all of them. If you don't people may think you're a phony. Best to spend more time on being trendy than get found out, right?

## Congrats! You should now have a happy life, being accepted by other people.
