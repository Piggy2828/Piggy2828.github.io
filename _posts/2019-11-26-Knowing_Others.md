## Now that you know who you are, let's move on to what you want to be a part of.

# Society. It's a big word.

#### Most people want to fit into society. Why would you want to be the outsider, endlessly shamed for your stangeness? However, most people are alienated because they are different than what is socially acepted. They fit into a bad stereotype. But enough about stereotypes. You already know about that. It's time to move on to learning about what everybody does, so you can change yourelf to fit in. 

## Without further ado, here are the charcteristics of those who you want to become like!

### 1. Not obsessed with anything
Have you ever nerded out about anything? Made yourself sound like a total geek in front of everybody? Nobody likes a guy who rants all day about something super boring. 

### 2. Don't like talking about academic stuff
This one's simple. Nobody likes a know-it-all. Just don't do it. You're making yourself seem like an arrogant snob and making the rest of us feel bad inside. 

### 3. Self-absorbed
If you've ever forgotten anybody's name in the first three minutes of meeting them, you're self-absorbed. Welcome to society! We only care about ourselves and will *always* put our well-being above others. 

### 4. Loves showing off
This one's a must. In order to fit in to society, you must look like you belong. All people love to hide their expensive stuff and make you ask them what they are. An example would be putting your latest iPhone into your jacket pocket so it sticks out *just a bit*, enough to get people's attention. When they ask, you say, "Oh, this old thing?" and explain how you bought it with your day's salary.
