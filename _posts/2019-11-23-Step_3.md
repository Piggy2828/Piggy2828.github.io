## You know who you are and what society is. Now it is time to transform into a member of it!

# Steps to Be Accepted:

### 1. Recognize that you are not perfect...yet.
It's OK to be different. Just kidding, it's not. You aren't perfect. You need to change.

### 2. Ignore all emotions that conflict with what is socially acceptable
Force yourself to be happy. Boring small talk? Great, I'm so excited! If you behave like everybody else, they will have no need to criticise you. 

### 3. Do what everybody else is doing
What is the new trend? What is the most popular song playing right now? If you want to fit in, you must have the same interests as everyone as well. That means sacrificing your individualism. But hey, it's worth it, right? Fitting in is hard, but rewarding.

## You just have to do what everyone else is doing. It's not hard, as long as you put your heart and mind into it.
